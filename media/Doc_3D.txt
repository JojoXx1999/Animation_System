The 3D animation system combines meshes and animations
using the Gef library.

When using the 3D animation system you can control the
camera using the arrow keys

There is no specific naming convention required for
3D animations in this system as long as they are 
compatible .scn files.

Example Mesh: xbot.scn
Example Animation: walking_inplace.scn


Gui Controls:
Controls can be found at Project->Properties

	The file name can be changed to load in a new texture
	or mesh, the file name should include the full filepath
	and not include _tex, _ske or the file type in the name

	2D Animation: Switch to 2D animation, either sprite or
	rig depending on what was loaded most recently

	Animation 1: Full file path to starting animation

	Animation 1 Speed: The speed that represents this
	animation

	Animation 2: Full file path to next animation for blending

	Animation 2 Speed: The speed that represents this
	animation

	Speed: The current speed of the character

	Speed Multiplier: Speed of blending between animations

	Minimum Transition Speed: minimum amount of blending
	accepted

	Character Rotation: The rotation of the mesh in world-space

	Character Size: Size of the mesh

	Speed indicator shows current speed of the character
	
	Blend indicator shows the current blend value between
	the animations as a percentage.


Keyboard Controls:
	Space Bar: Toggle Ragdoll

	L: Increase the speed of the character

	K: Decrease the speed of the character

	A: Rotate the mesh clockwise

	D: Rotate the mesh anticlockwise

	W: Increase the size of the mesh

	S: Decrease the size of the mesh

	Left Arrow: Move camera view to the left

	Right Arrow: Move camera view to the right

	Up Arrow: Move camera view up

	Down Arrow: Move camera view down


Notes:
The speed of Animation1 can be faster or slower than Animation2
However they cannot be the same, if the user tries to input the
same speed it will be offset by a minimum value.
If the speed of the character is outwith the range of the new
speeds the character will be clamped to the new maximum/minimum

Animation1 and Animation2 cannot point to the same file, upon
entering the same animation Animation 1 and 2 will swap automatically
for example: starting walk->run, changing walk to run would cause the 
new animations to be: run->walk.
