The 2D animation system contains 2 different types
of animations that can be displayed: Rig and Sprite.

Rig animations use an image containing different components 
of the texture and connects them using bones.

Sprite animations use a Texture atlas which contain
each sprite that can be represented.

The correct behaviour for each type of these animations
is contained inside .json files.



Rig Animation:
Specific naming convention is required for this system:
	The png and texture json files should end: _tex

	The skeleton json files should end: _ske

	For example: Dragon_tex.png, Dragon_tex.json, Dragon_ske.json


Gui Controls:
Controls can be found at Project->Properties

	The file name can be changed to load in a new texture
	or mesh, the file name should include the full filepath
	and not include _tex, _ske or the file type in the name	

	3D animation: This button will load in the current
	3D animation mesh and animation

	Sprite Animation: This button will switch to the 2D Sprite
	Animation

	Walk: Causes the character to walk in place
	
	Idle: Sets the animation to Idle
	
	Jump: Causes the character to jump

	Max Jump Height: The highest point (above ground level) that
	the player can reach

	Ground Level: The lowest point that the player can reach 
	(Where upwards is the negative direction)


Keyboard Controls:

	Left Arrow: Move the character to the left

	Right Arrow: Move the character to the right

	Up Arrow: Increase the size of the rig

	Down Arrow: Decrease the size of the rig

	Space Bar: Causes the chartacter to jump



Sprite Animation:
Specific naming convention is required for this system:
	The png and texture json files should end: _tex

	The skeleton json files should end: _ske

For example: girl_and_boy_tex.json, girl_and_boy_ske.json
	     girl_and_boy_tex.png


Gui Controls:
Controls can be found at Project->Properties

	The file name can be changed to load in a new texture
	or mesh, the file name should include the full filepath
	and not include _tex, _ske or the file type in the name

	3D animation: This button will load in the current
	3D animation mesh and animation

	Rig Animation: This button will switch to the 2D Rig
	Animation

	Next Animation From Texture Atlas: This button will
	display the next animation from the texture atlas in the
	order they were loaded.

	Previous Animation From Texture Atlas: This button will
	display the previous animation from the texture atlas in the
	order they were loaded.

	Random Animation From Texture Atlas: This button will
	display a random animation from the texture atlas.


Keyboard Controls:
	None
