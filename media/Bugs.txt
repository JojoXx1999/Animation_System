Bug:
Loading in an animation file instead of a mesh
and then proceeding to change the running animations
causes the program to crash because it cannot find 
the required mesh

Fix: 
Introduce error handling to test load the selected
mesh to ensure it doesn't fail, same as what is already
implemented in 2D animation; If mesh/texture doesn't
exist, revert to a known animation

Bug:
Similarly, loading in an animation file that doesnt exist will cause
the application as it can't find the relevant data

Fix: 
Same as above
