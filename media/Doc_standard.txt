Attributes can be changed in real-time by 
going to Project->Properties.
the properties displayed will change depending
on the animation type currently being displayed,
for example: 2D rig, 2D sprite or 3D animations.

The file name can be altered to load a new
texture or Mesh, this uses the absolute file
path and files can be loaded from outwith the
solution directory.

The file type name should NOT be included in
the file name this will be added for you by the
program, accepted types are .scn and .json
The file name should also NOT include the
_tex or _ske at the end.

For example, for a file: 'Dragon_tex.png'
including Jsons: 'Dragon_tex.json' and
'Dragon_ske.json' the user should only
input 'Dragon' to load this aniamtion

2D or 3D files can be inputted and the program
will display the correct animation type, if two
files contain the same name with different types
the 2D file will be loaded.
if the inputted file path is incorrect the program
will automatically load and display the previous
3D animation.

Files can also be loaded by going to 
File->Load_Mesh_or_Texture. This will open
a file system, the red arrow can be used to 
exit the current file.
Files of interest are highlighted in yellow
this includes folders, .scn and .json files
Upon selecting a valid .scn or .json file the 
texture/mesh and it's corresponding
animation will be loaded in.
For 2D animation either the _tex or _ske
files can be selected, for 3D the mesh must
be selected, selecting an invalid file will
cause the program to load in the default 3D mesh.

The diagnostics window displays the current time
taken each frame (in milliseconds) and the fps
(frames per second). This window is displayed by
default but can be turned off in the Debug tab.

Every mesh, texture and animation that is loaded into
the system is stored to reduce memory costs as they only
need to be created/loaded in once.
